									<h3>Girl Scout Gold Award</h3>
									<p>The Gold Award is the highest achievement in Girl Scouting, recognizing girls who demonstrate 
										extraordinary leadership through projects that have sustainable impact in their communities and beyond. </p>
									<p>For my Gold Award project, I held a science, math, and engineering exploration day called STEAM Day for middle 
									and elementary school kids for my local area at my high school to show them that science can be fun. The event 
									consisted of 22 hands-on activities and learning displays that were designed to be fun, interactive, and educational, 
									encouraging kids to get interested and involved in STEM. Activities ranged from a wide variety of different 
									science and engineering topics, including robotics, astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics, aeronautics, electronics, 
									and meteorology. Some of the crowd favorites were: a liquid nitrogen demo, which had a charismatic presenter 
									demonstrating and teaching kids about the cool properties of liquid nitrogen by hammering a nail with an LN2 frozen 
									banana or making a balloon seemingly deflate by placing it in liquid nitrogen; a circuit board booth, where kids 
									learned how to solder by soldering a music-playing circuit board; a water rocket launch, where kids could learn about 
									rockets and water pressure by shooting off water bottle rockets; a robot demo, where kids could drive a 120-lb robot 
									that shoots exercise balls; and a Doppler On Wheels, which kids could go in an explore, learning about weather 
									surveillance technology and types of severe weather. Overall, I had 16 different science and engineering organizations 
									involved in the event, such as Zometool, Ball Aerospace, and a local FIRST Robotics team, either by running a booth 
									or by donating materials for an activity. The event had over 250 people in attendance, and survey feedback from attendees 
									was overwhelmingly positive.</p>

									<h3>Phi Sigma Rho Sorority Officer</h3>
									<p>Phi Sigma Rho is a social sorority for women in engineering and STEM majors that aims to provide
										academic excellence with a social balance. There are over 35 chapters nationwide.</p>
									<p>I started my journey with Phi Sigma Rho as a founding member of the Alpha Mu Chapter at University
										of Colorado, Boulder. Together with eight other women of varying engineering majors, I learned
										about the history, traditions, and values of Phi Sigma Rho. During this time, I served as colony
										secretary in charge of weekly colony communications and meeting notes. I aided in writing our chapter
										bylaws and tracking various other requirements for installation. Our hard work paid off and
										we were installed as a new chapter in January of 2017. </p>
									<p>After installation, I was elected into the position of Vice President of Standards, which I held for two years.
										My duties as VP of Standards included maintaining and editing the chapter bylaws, tracking and aiding active
										members in meeting their active point requirements (participation in various sorority events and functions),
										and leading the Standards Board, a committee of four members and myself in charge of enforcing chapter bylaws
										and taking disciplinary action when necessary. During my time as VP of Standards, I helped write and pass over
										five major pieces of legislation that were added to the chapter bylaws, and made numerous smaller edits and
										clarifications to the chapter bylaws. As such, I am confident in my ability to write clearly and concisely.</p>
